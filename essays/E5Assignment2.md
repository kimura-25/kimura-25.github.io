Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
The assignment was about implementing a login and registration page into our website from Assignment 1 and validating the user registration information to allow the user to make a purchase. A way we did this was by using the File I/O to create a json file to store the information and having the server use the file.

What did you learn from this assignment?
From this assignment, I learned that sometimes, the code is simpler than one might think. Additionally, it could just be a search away. The was I was able to find a lot of the validation code and the meaning behind it was simply by looking online, reading how it worked, and implementing it into the code.

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner, so therefore the amount I contributed was 100%.

How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I got help from Prof. Port whenever I needed it. I needed help with nearly most things, such as starting the validations for registration. Additionally, my login page did not work correctly and kept attempting to load, which was a matter of wrong order in the if-else statement. I also needed help with figuring out why I was unable to have labels appear for the registration validation.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
This assignment was similar in needing validation, but since we learned about creating the if-else statements for validations, it was more straightforward figuring out the rules to create the validations. 

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I spend about 20% of my time trying to figure out how to do something, 30% of my time writing code, and 50% trying to test and debug. Some of the time I used to write what I thought the code might be, but most of my time was spent staring at it trying to figure out what was happening.

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
What worked well was getting the validations set up. What did not work well was trying to get the parameters and use the variables in the querystring to make it appear in the web pages (the errors and the personalization with the name)

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I would be more careful in reading the error messages and correcting them. Through reading the error messages in the console, it made it easier to diagnose the problem and figure out what might be wrong. Initially, I was more frustrated that I didn’t know what was going on and why something didn’t work the way I wanted it to, but by reading the error messages more carefully, it eliminated some of those issues.

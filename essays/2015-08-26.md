Hello everyone! My name is Kelsey Ann Kimura, and I am a junior at the Shidler College of Business. I am currently earning a dual degree in Management Information Systems as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Music. The reason I chose to be an MIS major is because I wanted to be able to gain the technical skills necessary to thrive in the workforce. Since technology has become such a huge part of today's skill sets and has such a variety of uses, I want to be able to learn those skills to apply to my everyday work. This semester, I am taking ITM 352 and ITM 431, so hopefully those courses will go well for me.

For ITM 352 in particular, I have always wanted to take a coding/programming class but have never been able to find time to fully apply myself to learning. I used to be part of an organization called Girls Who Code in high school (and from whom I still receive emails from), and I found it interesting how one can do nearly everything through code, from building websites, to creating simple animations, to even solving the worlds problems. Although my conflicting schedule did not allow me to make it to meetings very often, it still showed me the immense value of coding. Although I am nervous as to how the class will go, I am still excited to learn new things through this course and to get started on my MIS major.

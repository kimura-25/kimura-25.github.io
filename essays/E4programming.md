Overall, I feel that my understanding of programming has improved since the beginning. Going through Assignment 1, I was forced to learn what each line of code meant and figure out how that applied to my own project. Additionally, I have been able to learn better to avoid common errors, such as missing brackets and semicolons and wrong variable references, and where to place them.

I’m not sure if I can necessarily say that I am enthusiastic about programming because through the WODs, labs, and first assignment, I have struggled a lot with understanding the code and getting it to work. However, I am proud of what I have accomplished in my output and understanding thus far. I went from knowing nothing about coding to creating a functional website with a server.

For the assignments, I have become slightly more confident in completing the WODs and labs. One time, we had to complete two “short” WODs for homework. Initially, I freaked out because there were no videos posted for them. Fortunately, although it took me a little over two hours to complete what was supposed to be a cumulative time of 12 minutes for both WODs. The ability to complete both without the videos gave me a sense of relief and boosted my confidence in that I was able to do both without help.

However, most WODs did not happen that way. Even after doing the readings, I usually am not sure what to do and watch the videos to understand  what is happening. Then I practice the WOD until I am able to do it without help, which tends to take a while. Still, from the WODs, I am able to understand how to do the code and why it is written that way. 

Overall, the labs were a bit difficult to understand, especially the one about servers. However, by following along in class, I was able to keep up and put together what we were learning. I am glad that we are walked through the lab in class because I would be completely lost otherwise, and the teacher explains what is happening and why, therefore helping me learn what is happening.

What has helped in the class was going slowly through the labs and pausing in between to make sure everyone was on track. This allowed us to slow down and understand what is happening. Also, as much as the WODs were difficult, they helped me learn and understand what was happening. However, one One way the class can be improved is by keeping a more consistent schedule. Sometimes, when we are coming to the end of class in the last 5 minutes, we end up rushing through the lab exercises and go over time, making it really hard to follow along and understand what is happening. Although I enjoy the slower pace, I feel that sometimes we take too long waiting on one exercise or retrieving files for the exercise. If we stayed on track, we would be more able to complete what we need at a smoother pace.

Although Assignment 1 is complete, I do not feel ready to move on to the next stage in programming. I feel I still have much to learn in-depth about other areas of programming, especially servers. However, Assignment 1 forced me to learn about the servers and how the different components of the server allow the website to function as is. Getting through those difficulties have better prepared me for the next stage, but I’m not sure if I necessarily feel ready.

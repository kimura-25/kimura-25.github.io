Recently, I just completed my first set of WODs. It definitely took up a lot more time than expected. Although the times that it should take to finish the exercises are under 20-30 minutes per exercise, each one definitely took longer than it should have. For example, I have been on Browser History 2 for hours on end trying to figure out what was not working. Although I cannot exactly remember what it was at the moment, I feel that a lot of my mistakes have come from missing something as small as a semi colon, or forgetting a tag somewhere.

I will admit that each of the exercises took a while to complete. BrowserHistory1 was pretty straight-forward, but it had its share of difficulty. The one that took the longest was surprisingly the BrowserHistory2, or the introduction to CSS. As stated earlier, I feel that a lot of my problems came from something small such as a semi-colon, so some lines of code did not work.
